# Customer Cohort Analyses Software
I created a software for cohort analyses in python with the package so called Tkinter. It calculates the number of customers and the revenue of customers yearly basis and saves it automatically to an excel file. Cohort Analyses can also be done for revenue groups.

The software accepts an excel file and after finalising the analyses saves the Cohort_final.xls file to the path where Cohort_app_v2.exe file or Cohort_app_v2.py is located.

If you would like to use it as standalone .exe file and if you do not work to use python, please use pyinstaller for that reason.
